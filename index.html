<p>A major challenge for bicycle sharing programs like Hubway is redistribution of resources across the transportation 
network. Certain bicycle stations are chronically empty at certain times of the day, while others are often full, 
forcing riders to find another, more inconvenient station at which to drop off the bike. This element of uncertainty 
detracts from the otherwise seamless user experience. To partially remedy this problem, Hubway uses vans to redistribute
the bikes across stations each day. However, this strategy is ad hoc and haphazard. It adds to company costs and 
moreover detracts from the environmental benefits that Hubway offers. This problem calls for a more scientific 
approach to both the redistribution of bikes across stations and the provision of information to customers. We propose
a new data science program that informs customers of the likelihood that either a bicycle or an empty bike dock will 
be available at a given station at some future point in time. This will help improve user experience for customers 
and inform distribution efforts for the Hubway team.</p>

<span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Objectives</h3>

<p>Our study began with a single broad question: what will each Hubway station look like during a given 15 minute 
interval sometime in the future? It is the nature of data science to force scientists to rethink their questions, and
we quickly realized that our initial question was overly broad, difficult to answer, and perhaps not even useful for 
riders. As the project continued, the questions evolved. Eventually, four primary questions emerged to drive our 
analysis:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How do environmental variables affect the future state of Hubway stations?</li>
  <li>What do usage patterns look like with respect to specific stations and how that translates to imbalances in the
  system?</li>
  <li>Can we integrate these explanatory variables and these usage patterns into a predictive algorithm that would 
  predict empty and full stations in the near future?</li>
  <li>What form should that algorithm take?</li>
</ul>

<p>This last question shifted late in the project, however, when the results of our analysis indicated that a single 
style of algorithm might fail to produce solidly dependable results. Ultimately, we concluded the project by asking: 
What are the strengths and weaknesses of each of our algorithm designs, and how do they point toward a future ensemble 
prediction method?</p>

<span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Approach</h3>

<p>Hubway ridership trends depend upon time of day, time of year, commute patterns, weather, and events such as sports.
We began our study by scraping relevant datasets from the Hubway website as well as websites detailing weather and 
sports event histories for Boston during 2012. We then performed a series of small exploratory data analyses with the
hope of understanding how different variables were associated with one another. These explorations revealed important
patterns about Hubway ridership on weekdays vs. weekends, in good weather vs. bad weather, and before and after 
baseball games. We also incorporated mapping and clustering operations into our exploratory phase: we used simple 
techniques to identify how location affects station ridership and more complicated techniques such as singular value 
decomposition to group stations according to temporal use patterns and map them geographically. The information 
collected during the exploration phase informed the creation of three predictive algorithms: one using random forest
classification, another using bayesian inference, and third using multiple regression. For each method, we used a test set of data to 
determine how well the algorithm performed, in terms of an accuracy measure called recall, against a baseline model
that predicted future station status based entirely on station status 15 minutes previously.</p>
