<p>A major challenge for bicycle sharing programs like Hubway is redistribution of resources across the transportation 
network. Certain bicycle stations are chronically empty at certain times of the day, while others are often full, 
forcing riders to find another, more inconvenient station at which to drop off the bike. This element of uncertainty 
detracts from the otherwise seamless user experience. To partially remedy this problem, Hubway uses vans to redistribute
the bikes across stations each day. However, this strategy is ad hoc and haphazard. It adds to company costs and 
moreover detracts from the environmental benefits that Hubway offers. This problem calls for a more scientific 
approach to both the redistribution of bikes across stations and the provision of information to customers. We propose
a new data science program that informs customers of the likelihood that either a bicycle or an empty bike dock will 
be available at a given station at some future point in time. This will help improve user experience for customers 
and inform distribution efforts for the Hubway team.</p>
